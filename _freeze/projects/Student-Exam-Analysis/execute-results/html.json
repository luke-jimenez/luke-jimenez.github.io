In order to do this, lets first load in our data and packages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nNow that we have our data lets take a look at all of our variables in the data set.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr(data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nspc_tbl_ [1,000 Ã— 10] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ gender                     : num [1:1000] 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 ...\n $ race_ethnicity             : chr [1:1000] \"group B\" \"group C\" \"group B\" \"group A\" ...\n $ parental_level_of_education: chr [1:1000] \"bachelor's degree\" \"some college\" \"master's degree\" \"associate's degree\" ...\n $ lunch                      : num [1:1000] 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 ...\n $ test_preparation_course    : num [1:1000] 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 ...\n $ math_score                 : num [1:1000] 72 69 90 47 76 71 88 40 64 38 ...\n $ reading_score              : num [1:1000] 72 90 95 57 78 83 95 43 64 60 ...\n $ writing_score              : num [1:1000] 74 88 93 44 75 78 92 39 67 50 ...\n $ total_score                : num [1:1000] 218 247 278 148 229 232 275 122 195 148 ...\n $ average_score              : num [1:1000] 72.7 82.3 92.7 49.3 76.3 ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   gender = col_double(),\n  ..   race_ethnicity = col_character(),\n  ..   parental_level_of_education = col_character(),\n  ..   lunch = col_double(),\n  ..   test_preparation_course = col_double(),\n  ..   math_score = col_double(),\n  ..   reading_score = col_double(),\n  ..   writing_score = col_double(),\n  ..   total_score = col_double(),\n  ..   average_score = col_double()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=<externalptr> \n```\n:::\n:::\n\nWe have 10 variables total:\n\n- **\"gender\"**: The gender of the student; 1 is female, and 0 is male\n\n- **\"race_ethnicity\"**: The race or ethnicity of a student split into anonymous groups labeled group A, group B, etc.\n\n- **\"parental_level_of_education\"**: The highest education achieved by the parents of the student\n\n- **\"lunch\"**: Whether or not the student had lunch before the test; 1 is yes, 0 is no\n\n- **\"test_preparation_course\"**: Whether or not the student took a test preparation course before the test; 1 is yes, 0 is no\n\n- **\"math_score\"**: The score the student received on the math portion of the test\n\n- **\"reading_score\"**: The score the student received on the reading portion of the test\n\n- **\"writing_score\"**: The score the student received on the writing portion of the test\n\n- **\"total_score\"**: The total score of the student which is the sum of their math, reading, and writing scores\n\n- **\"average_score\"**: The average score a student achieved between their math, reading, and writing scores\n\n\n# Qualitative analysis\n\nNow that we understand the data set, lets look to see what different variables helped improve or decrease a students test score. To better understand the distribution of the scores we can look at the math, reading, and writing scores as box plots.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmath_box <- ggplot(data, aes(x='', y = math_score))+geom_boxplot(fill = 'lightblue', width = 0.5)+theme_light() + ylab('Math Score') + theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank())\nreading_box <- ggplot(data, aes(x='', y = reading_score))+geom_boxplot(fill = 'pink', width = 0.5)+theme_light() + ylab('Reading Score')+ theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank())\nwriting_box <- ggplot(data, aes(x='', y = writing_score))+geom_boxplot(fill = 'lightyellow', width = 0.5)+theme_light() + ylab('Writing Score')+ theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank())\n\n\n(math_box|reading_box|writing_box)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Student-Exam-Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooking at these box plots we see that the distribution of scores among the math, reading, and writing categories is relatively similar for each student. Now lets start to implement new variables into the graphs in order to find out which ones could be predictive. Let's start with what would be logically assumed to be significant for a students score, the test preparation course.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- data %>% mutate(test_preparation_course = factor(test_preparation_course))\n\n#Allows the legends to correctly label the different colors\ndata1 <- data %>% mutate(test_preparation_course = factor(test_preparation_course, levels = c(0, 1),labels = c(\"No Prep\", \"Completed Prep\")))\n\nmath_box_test <- ggplot(data1, aes(x='', y = math_score, fill = test_preparation_course))+geom_boxplot(width = 0.5)+theme_light() + ylab('Math Score') + theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank())+labs(fill = 'Test Preparation')+xlab('')\n\nreading_box_test <- ggplot(data1, aes(x='', y = reading_score, fill = test_preparation_course))+geom_boxplot(width = 0.5)+theme_light() + ylab('Reading Score')+ theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank()) + labs(fill = 'Test Preparation')+xlab('')\n\nwriting_box_test <- ggplot(data1, aes(x='', y = writing_score, fill = test_preparation_course))+geom_boxplot(width = 0.5)+theme_light() + ylab('Writing Score')+ theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank()) +labs(fill = 'Test Preparation')+xlab('')\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Student-Exam-Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Student-Exam-Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Student-Exam-Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see a noticeable increase in score for students who completed the test preparation course versus those students who didn't. Now to get a more complete picture of the impact of the test preparation on average score and we can test this by looking at the distribution of students who took the test course over the group of students in each letter grade.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Add letter grade column\n\ndata1 <- data1 %>%\n  mutate(letter_grade = case_when(\n    average_score >= 90 ~ \"A\",\n    average_score >= 80 ~ \"B\",\n    average_score >= 70 ~ \"C\",\n    average_score >= 60 ~ \"D\",\n    TRUE ~ \"F\"\n  ))\n\ngroup <- data1 %>% group_by(letter_grade, test_preparation_course) %>% summarize(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')\n\naverage_score_bar <- ggplot(group, aes(x = letter_grade, y = count, fill = test_preparation_course))+geom_col(position = 'dodge')+ theme_light() + ylab(\"Count\") + xlab(\"Letter Grade\") + labs(fill = \"Test Preparation Course\")\n\naverage_score_bar\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Student-Exam-Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can notice the trend that students who got an \"A\" or \"B\" average score were much more likely to have taken the preparation course than the students who got a \"C\" or below average score. This helps us identify the test preparation course as a significant variable in predicting score. Now lets look at another variable that may not matter as much, the lunch variable. Lets recreate the graphs from above, but with lunch instead of test preparation course.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Allows the legends to correctly label the different colors\n\ndata1 <- data1 %>% mutate(lunch = data$lunch)\n\n\ndata1 <- data1 %>% mutate(lunch = factor(lunch, levels = c(0, 1),labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\")))\n\n\nmath_box_lunch <- ggplot(data1, aes(x='', y = math_score, fill = lunch))+geom_boxplot(width = 0.5)+theme_light() + ylab('Math Score') + theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank())+labs(fill = 'Did the student have lunch?')+xlab('')\n\nreading_box_lunch <- ggplot(data1, aes(x='', y = reading_score, fill = lunch))+geom_boxplot(width = 0.5)+theme_light() + ylab('Reading Score') + theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank())+labs(fill = 'Did the student have lunch?')+xlab('')\n\nwriting_box_lunch <- ggplot(data1, aes(x='', y = writing_score, fill = lunch))+geom_boxplot(width = 0.5)+theme_light() + ylab('Math Score') + theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank())+labs(fill = 'Did the student have lunch?')+xlab('')\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Student-Exam-Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Student-Exam-Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Student-Exam-Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSimilar to test preparation, the students who had lunch seemed to do noticeably better on the test than students who did not have lunch. We can further analyzing this by looking at the students letter grade from their average score and comparing the students from within each group based on if they ate lunch.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngroup2 <- data1 %>% group_by(letter_grade, lunch) %>% summarize(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')\n\naverage_score_bar_lunch <- ggplot(group2, aes(x = letter_grade, y = count, fill = lunch))+geom_col(position = 'dodge')+ theme_light() + ylab(\"Count\") + xlab(\"Letter Grade\") + labs(fill = \"Did the student have lunch?\")\n\naverage_score_bar_lunch\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Student-Exam-Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nShockingly, the proportion of students who had lunch in each letter grade seemed to matter very much to their success. Higher grades like an 'A' or 'B' had most of the students eat lunch, while students who got a 'D' or 'F' were much more likely to not have eaten lunch. Another variable we can take a look at is the parental education of the student and the impact of that on their average score. In order to do this, lets first turn the parental education variable into a factor of ranked levels.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata1 <- data1 %>% mutate()\n```\n:::\n",
